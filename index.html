   <h3> Elephants</h3>

   <p>I have a very passionate interest in animals, particularly elephants. While I like both species of elephants, African Elephants are the ones I like the most. Since elephants are on the endagered list, I like to often volenteer for or donate to elephant preservation efforts such as <a href="https://www.savetheelephants.org/">Save the Elephants</a> and <a href="https://elephantconservation.org/">international Elephant Foundation</a>.</p>
   <h3>Reading</h3>

   <p>One of my main hobbies is reading. I like to read anything from novels to web comics and anything in between. My favorite genres are horror/thriller, fantasy, romance, and paranormal. A few of my favorite authors and series are: <a href="https://shellylaurenston.com/series/pride-stories/">The Pride Series</a> by Shelly Laurenston, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/46385-lords-of-the-underworld">The Lords of the Underworld Series</a> by Gena Showalter, and <a href="https://www.deankoontz.com/book-series/odd-thomas">Odd Thomas Series</a> by Dean Koontz.</p>

   <p id='jump'>Another hobby I enjoy is to travel. I've mainly traveled within the U.S., but plan to travel out of the country as much as I can. Some places at the top of my list are: Japan,Switzerland, Costa Rica, Brazil, and China.</p>
   <h3 id='hop'>Career Hopes</h3>
   <p id='blah'>Ultimately, I hope to find a career that allows me the opportunities to both be productive in my chosen career and able to pursue my interests such as traveling, volunteering, and reading.Hiving a career where I can work remotely and travel at the same time, would be the ultimate dream.</p>
