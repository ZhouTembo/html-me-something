   <h3> Elephants</h3>
   <p>I have a very passionate interest in animals, particularly <em><strong>Elephants</strong></em>.While I like both species of elephants, African Elephants are the ones I like the most. Since elephants are on the endagered list, I like to often volenteer for or donate to elephant preservation efforts.</p>
   <h3>Reading</h3>
   <p>One of my main hobbies is reading. I like to read anything from novels to web comics and anything in between. My favorite genres are horror/thriller, fantasy, romance, and paranormal.A few of my favorite authors and series are: The Shifter Series by Shelly Laurenston.</p>
   <h3>Traveling</h3>
   <p>Another hobby I enjoy is to travel. I've mainly traveled within the U.S., but plan to travel out of the country as much as I can. Some places at the top of my list are: Japan,Switzerland, Costa Rica, Brazil, and China.</p>
